const faqData = [
  {
    q: "When do I get paid?",
    a: "Instantly. The moment someone uses your referral link to join Zuri Agency, KES 350 is sent directly to your registered M-Pesa number. There is no waiting period, no monthly payout cycle, and no minimum balance requirement. Your upline commission of KES 150 is also triggered instantly. Both payments happen simultaneously within seconds of the new member completing their registration. This instant payout model is one of the reasons our members trust Zuri Agency — you see the results of your effort immediately, not at the end of the month.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a limit to how much I can earn?",
    a: "There is absolutely no earning cap at Zuri Agency. You can earn KES 350 per direct referral and KES 150 per team referral, and there is no upper limit on how many people you can refer or how many team members you can have. Some of our top earners are making over KES 70,000 per month because their teams continue to grow and generate override commissions even while they sleep. Whether you refer 5 people or 5,000 people, the commission structure remains the same. Your earning potential is directly tied to your effort and your team's growth — nothing else.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can my earnings grow over time without referring more people myself?",
    a: "Yes, and this is where the real power of the Zuri Agency model reveals itself. Once you refer someone, they become part of your team. When they refer others, you earn KES 150 per referral without doing any additional work. This creates a passive income stream that grows as your team expands. For example, if you refer 10 people, and each of them refers just 5 people, you earn KES 350 x 10 = KES 3,500 from your direct referrals plus KES 150 x 50 = KES 7,500 from your team referrals, totalling KES 11,000. Your earnings compound as your team builds their own teams.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I withdraw my earnings?",
    a: "Withdrawals are fully automatic. Every commission you earn is sent directly to your M-Pesa account the moment the referral is completed. There is no separate withdrawal step, no request form, no minimum payout threshold, and no processing delay. The money simply arrives as an M-Pesa notification on your phone. This seamless payout system means you never have to worry about forgotten withdrawals or lost earnings. Your M-Pesa statement becomes your earnings record, and every transaction is traceable and verifiable.",

                  When someone pays KES 1,000 to join Zuri Agency, KES 500 is yours to earn. KES 350 goes directly to you as the person who referred them, and KES 150 goes to the person who referred you. This 50% payout ratio is among the highest in the industry. Most referral platforms pay 20-30% at best. We pay 50% because we believe that the people building the community deserve the largest share of the value they create. The remaining KES 500 keeps the platform running — servers, support, M-Pesa integration fees, security, and continuous improvement.
