Refer 3 people (KES 1,050) and you’re KES 550 profit. That’s not a promise — that’s math. And it’s why 5,000+ Kenyans chose us over every other hustle.",

Imagine referring just 5 people who each refer 5 more. That is 5 direct commissions (KES 1,750) plus 25 override commissions (KES 3,750) = KES 5,500 total.

  {
    q: "Is this really free after the joining fee?",
    a: "Yes, absolutely. That is the whole point. KES 1,000 is your one and only payment. There are no monthly fees, no annual subscriptions, no maintenance charges, no hidden deductions. You could refer 100 people over the next five years and never pay another shilling. Many people do not believe this at first because they have been burned by other platforms, but we operate on transparency. If we charged monthly fees, we would tell you upfront. We do not, because we believe your earnings should be yours to keep.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need followers or influence to earn?",
    a: "Not at all. You do not need to be an influencer, a celebrity, or even active on social media. Some of our highest earners are everyday Kenyans — teachers, boda boda riders, salon operators, stay-at-home parents — who simply share their link with people they already know. Your personal network is more valuable than you think. Think about everyone you interact with: family members, friends, neighbours, church members, former classmates. Every single one of them is a potential referral. You do not need thousands of followers; you just need to start with the people who already trust you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it too late to join?",
    a: "No, and here is why: Kenya is still in the early adoption phase of referral-based income platforms. While a few thousand people have joined, millions of Kenyans have not even heard of this opportunity yet. The market is wide open. Those who join now have the advantage of building their network early, before the concept becomes mainstream. Think of it like M-Pesa in its early days — those who signed up early and referred others built something lasting. The same principle applies here. The best time to join was yesterday. The second best time is now.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I am not good at convincing people?",
    a: "You do not need to convince anyone. You simply share your link and let the platform speak for itself. Most people who join do so because they see others earning, not because of aggressive sales tactics. We provide you with ready-made messages, images, and resources that you can share directly. You do not need to be a salesperson. You just need to be willing to share an opportunity with people who might benefit from it. The rest takes care of itself.",
